This repository contains the code used to produce [interactive visualizations](http://f.briatte.org/parlviz) of legislative cosponsorship networks in [18 European countries](https://github.com/briatte/parlnet) and in the [European Parliament](https://github.com/briatte/epam).

The Javascript code was hacked from [sigma.js / examples / load-external-gexf.html](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/blob/master/examples/load-external-gexf.html) (parser) and [osdc2012-demo](http://jcml.fr/~jacomyal/osdc2012-demo/) (searchbox) by [Alexis Jacomy](https://github.com/jacomyal).

The [visualization](http://f.briatte.org/parlviz/marsad/) of the [Tunisian Constituent Assembly](https://github.com/briatte/marsad), which is not included in the repository, uses code from the [InteractiveVis project](https://github.com/oxfordinternetinstitute/InteractiveVis/) at the [Oxford Internet Institute](http://blogs.oii.ox.ac.uk/vis/).

Please use the [issues](issues) to report bugs or suggestions about the visualizations. If you find a bug that affects data collection or network construction, please report it in the corresponding repository.
